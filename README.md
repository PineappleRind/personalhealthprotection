### About us

We are a blogging website. On our website we post updates and blogs about the ongoing global pandemic.

Since the pandemic is slowing down, this website when finished *might* be used for some other blog.
Most of the articles will be written by [@FFlop](https://github.com/fflop)

Note: the website is not online yet.
