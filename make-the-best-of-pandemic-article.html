                <h3>2. Head outdoors.</h3>
                <hr>Green spaces lift your spirits and make working out seem less effortful. Go for a run or play catch in your backyard. Research nearby parks and trails where your family can move around and keep a safe distance.

                <h1>Finding your Purpose</h1>

                Dealing with any hardship can be an opportunity to build character. Use your extra free time to create a more meaningful life.
                <br>
                Consider these ideas:
                <h3>1. Meditate and pray.</h3>
                <hr>
                Invest in your spiritual development. Read inspirational texts. Browse online for videos and podcasts that many faith communities are offering. Start a daily meditation practice.
                <h3>2. Help others.</h3>
                <hr>
                Shifting your attention to others can help you to keep your own troubles in perspective. Ask your favorite charity about how to volunteer online. See if your elderly neighbors need groceries or an occasional phone call.
                <h3>3. Continue learning.</h3>
                <hr>
                Make a list of subjects you want to explore for your personal enrichment or career advancement. Read books and take courses online. See what your local library has to offer on their website or through curbside services.
                <h3>4. Limit screen time.</h3>
                <hr>
                Resist the temptation to binge watch TV shows and movies. Save your time and energy for activities with a greater pay off.
